* Bookman

** Notes

BookMan is a local bookmark manager: it provides a friendly UI
to save & organize bookmarks, and can persist the data via the browser's localStorage.

*** Issues/Fixes

**** DONE When rendering pre-existing bookmarks, the tag array is not updated :fix:
**** DONE When deleting a BM, the array in localStorage is not updated :fix:

**** DONE If local bookmarks are imported manually, tags are not updated in state :fix:
**** TODO When deleting a BM, tags in state are not updated             :fix:
     We can't just remove the tags associated w/ the deleted BM; those tags could be in use by other BMs.
     We have to check if the tags are not used by other BMs: if true, we can remove them.
**** DONE When importing from localStorage, tag array is not flattened  :fix:
**** DONE Tag sorting for BMs w/ multiple tags is broken
**** TODO Bookmark delete control doesn't work in tag sort view         :fix:
**** DONE Deduplicate tags in the tag sidebar                           :fix:
**** DONE When BM has single tag, PillButton styles are broken          :fix:
